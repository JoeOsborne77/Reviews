# Exercise: String Calculator

# Language: JavaScript

# I use an agile process. Rating: Strong
You did a great job gathering information about how the program should work clearing up some of the finer details. You also made excellent use of an input-output table with your own examples in order to flesh out the behaviours a bit starting from the simplest cases to the more complex cases. This served you very well when you started creating your tests as you just copy-pasted these inputs and outputs into your tests thereby encoding the requirements as confirmed with the client into the tests. This ensured that your algorithm would adhere to all of the acceptance criteria.

You have also comprehensively covered edge cases in this session. Well done.

# I can model anything. Rating: Strong
You modelled your solution as a single function to begin with, which was a nice and simple choice. Considering the stateless nature of the problem, I also feel that this was a particularly good fit for this exercise.

You have used the correct naming conventions for Javascript.

The algorithm that you were creating made logical sense and was building up to a solution that took care of many of the requirements.

# I can TDD anything. Rating: Strong
You have implemented in the previous review sessions and are reaping the benefits from the TDD approach that has been proposed in the review sessions. You are testing for behaviours rather than implementation, your tests are client-oriented, you have a logical incremental test progression and you follow the RGR cycle very closely. All of this leads to code that is easy to change, well cleaned up, thoroughly tested and evolved in a natural and incremental fashion. Well done.

# I can program fluently. Rating: Strong
You seemed comfortable enough using the terminal and editor to set up your environment.

You seemed to have a sufficient level of knowledge in all of the relevant programming constructs needed to solve the problem.

Excellent work here!

# I can refactor anything. Rating: Nothing here
You did excellent refactoring by removing code from the main function and creating separate modules with helper functions. Really good work.

# I can debug anything. Rating: Strong
Due to the incremental nature of your process, you did not need to debug much. Very well done.

# I write code that is easy to change. Rating: Steady
You have properly decoupled your code from your tests by testing for behaviours and not implementation details. This promotes flexibility in your code and allows for changes and refactors without breaking the test suite.

Unfortunately, your choice of variable name did not accurately reflect the information being held in that variable. For example, the input to your method, ‘str’, did not describe what it was modelling. Generally, I would advise against using data types as variable names, as it does not describe what information is being held in the variable. In this case, I would recommend something along the lines of “sumString”.

You have used Git commits regularly as well in this session.

# I have a methodological approach to problem solving. Rating: Strong
You have committed whenever your tests pass which aids in being able to roll back to a previous safe version if you were to run into any trouble with new additions to the code or refactors.

You have followed the RGR cycle very closely throughout the process. Well done.

# I can justify the way I work. Rating: Steady
You were for the most part quite vocal and were communicating what you were doing and your thought process behind the decisions that you were making. There were some points where you were speaking at a low level as if you were speaking to yourself. Try to always aim your commentary toward the interviewer/reviewer.

# General feedback
There was so much improvement overall in this review session. You have taken the feedback from previous sessions and incorporated it all very well into your process. There are just some minor adjustments that need to be made, but your process is very good at this stage.
